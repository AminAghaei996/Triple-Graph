# Triple-Graph
This is a project to plot three graphs of three selected countries by the user.
The Python scripts derive the data from the Data.csv file
the data is about the rate of urban population to the total population in countries from 1960 to 2022
The user can select 3 countries at the beginning, then the software will plot the urban population rate for all three countries in the same figure; Therefore, the user can compare selected countries clearly simultaneously.
Note: the user has to change the directory of Data.csv in the code based on their local directory, otherwise, the script cannot open the Data.csv
